PyDesigner is a complete Python port of NYU's DESIGNER pipeline for preprocessing diffusion MRI images (dMRI). This work was motivated by:

    * Minimization of **dependencies** to make it easier to deploy and understandable metric compared to the size in bytes.
    * **Faster** dMRI preprocessing
    * More **accurate** diffusion and kurtosis tensor estimation via cutting-edge algorithms
    * **Cross-platform compatibility** between Windows, Mac and Linux
    * **Ease-of-use** through Python classes so anyone can preprocess dMRI data
    * **Docker** compatibility for enhanced deployment

This is a collaboration project between MUSC and NYU to bring easy-to-use dMRI preprocessing and diffusion and kurtosis tensor estimation to masses.
